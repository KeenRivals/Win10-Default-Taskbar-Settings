# Default Taskbar Settings

Applies registry settings to hide some buttons from the taskbar by default. Users can change their preference later. Works by loading the default users' registry hive, applying keys to hide specific buttons, then unloads the hive. When a new user logs in to the machine, they'll see the customized taskbar.
